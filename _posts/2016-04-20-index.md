      <div class="message"><ul>
        <li>To enable engineers and data scientist to utilize standard AI/ML toolchain on non-standard proprietary GPGPU cluster, I developed custom distributed deep learning stack including custom collective communication solution for non-standard proprietary communication fabric.</li>
        <li>I help design GPGPU cluster using non-standard proprietary hardware for distributed deep learning workload.</li>
        <li>Using low-rank learning method we developed in collaboration with UW-Madison, I reduced memory footprint of several of our neural network learning tasks by up to 50%.</li>
        <li>I coordinate our team research collaboration effort with UW-Madison, which resulted in the publication: PUFFERFISH: Communication-efficient Models at No Extra Cost.</li>
        <li>I coordinate our team research collaboration effort with Georgia Tech, which resulted in the publication: Nested Dithered Quantization for Communication Reduction in Distributed Training.</li>
        <li>I developed a distributed deep learning simulator, which help our team broke world record of ImageNet/ResNet-50 training speed. During ABCI Grand Challenge 2018, we gained access to the entire ABCI cluster only for a limited time. The simulator allows us to do dry hyper-parameter tuning, thus significantly reducing the number of experiments required on the cluster.</li>
        <li>I work on NNabla, Sony’s high-performance deep learning framework. I am responsible for distributed learning performance optimization as well as designing next-generation distributed learning API.</li>
        <!-- My research focuses on the effective utilization of HPC resources and distributed computing for machine learning and deep learning tasks, including optimization of collective communication as well as distributed learning algorithms. -->

        <li>PRAGMA-ENT Breakable international SDN testbed for PRAGMA community. I help established and maintained this network, which connect multiple institutions including NAIST, Osaka University, University of California San Diego, and University of Florida.</li>
        <li>Applying Deep Learning to Network Traffic Identification and Categorization I developed network traffic classification model using stacked denoising autoencoder in TensorFlow. This model is learned on the CAIDA Internet traffic dataset. The model is a part of my proposal to create automatic SDN-based data center network traffic optimizer.</li>
        <li>Container Rebalancing I proposed a novel scheduling mechanism with a rebalancing processing working alongside a scheduling process. A Hadoop/Hive-powered data processing technique and a Python-based simulation using Google’s cluster data is performed to validate this method.</li>
